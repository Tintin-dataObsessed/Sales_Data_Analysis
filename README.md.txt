Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data by converting data types, and filling missing values in unit price with the mean to ensure that calculations do not result in errors. I then eliminated duplicates cautiously by making sure multiple entries with the same date and values would be grouped rather than dropped because there is no transaction ID to ensure that similar records are dropped.
I then created the new Month Year feature.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Provided a sales overview of category and business with Quantity and Value.


Advanced Analysis:
I used a segmentation method to classify businesses, and categories based on their transaction frequency, quantity, and value with extensive recommendations through comments after the code.



Strategic Insights and Recommendations:My recommendations are shown in Sales PowerPoint.

Dashboard and Reporting: This is in Tableau
